## Getting Started

 For this you will need
- Gitbash/Bash (Windows/Linux and Apple)
- VsCode or Editor of your choice
- Python 3.6 or later

## Installations
---
#### Install Python

```bash
python --version
```

#### Set up virtual environment
---
If you have python installed the next set is to create a `projects` folder if you dont already have one
```bash
mkdir projects
cd projects
```
To use a virtual environment, we'll create and activate it. We create it by using the venv module, which you installed as part of your Python installation instructions earlier. When we activate it, we tell our system to use the folder we created for all of its Python needs

```bash
# Windows, macOS or Linux
# Create the environment
python -m venv venv
```
Then we want to activate the said environment
```bash
# Windows
# Activate the environment
./venv/scripts/activate

# macOS or Linux
# Activate the environment
source ./venv/bin/activate
```

Open the directory in Visual Studio Code
```bash
code .
```
This command opens the current directory (.) in Visual Studio Code.

Create a requirements.txt file

In Visual Studio Code, in the Explorer window, select "New File" next to the contoso directory. Name the file `requirements.txt` and add the following text:

```plaintext
flask
python-dotenv
requests
```
Save the requirements.txt file
Save the file by clicking Ctrl-S (Cmd-S on a Mac) or using the save option in the editor.

Install dependencies using pip
Return to the command or terminal window and run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command installs the Python libraries listed in the requirements.txt file, along with their dependencies.
Make sure you have Python and pip installed on your system before running these commands. Also, ensure that the terminal or command prompt is set to the correct directory where your project is located.

---
### Using the Application
---
Open the integrated terminal
Run the following command to set the Flask runtime to development, which means that the server will automatically reload with every change

```Bash
# Windows
set FLASK_ENV=development

# Linux/macOS
export FLASK_ENV=development
```
Then to run the applicatoin on your local machine run:
```Bash
flask run
```

Open the application in a browser by navigating to http://localhost:5000

### Adding Languages
---
As of right now there are only 8 options 
```HTML
<select name="language" class="form-control">
    <option value="en">English</option>
    <option value="es">Spanish</option>
    <option value="fr">French</option>
    <option value="it">Italian</option>
    <option value="ja">Japanese</option>
    <option value="ru">Russian</option>
    <option value="de">German</option>
    <option value="ar">Arabic</option>
</select>
```

To add more options you have to copy one of those a lines
paste it and where the `value` is set enter your selected language. 
This is what interacted with the API for the translate language.
